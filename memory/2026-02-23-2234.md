assistant: Done ✅

**CLAWKER.NET IS LIVE**

```
https://clawker.net → CLAWKER landing page
```

**What I did:**
- Copied the site to a clean deploy directory
- Deployed via Workers with custom domain routing
- Now serving the full CLAWKER site (not just "Hello world")

**Technical:**
- Worker: `percy-corp-2` 
- Routes to: `clawker.net` (custom domain)
- Tech: Cloudflare Workers + Static Assets

**Also:**
- ✅ Memory updated
- ✅ Synced to Cloudflare + Obsidian + GitHub

The site is live at **https://clawker.net** 🦞

Great. Did you make notes of all that? We’re going to be working on that site a lot in the near future
assistant: Yes, documented ✅

**What's logged:**

1. **Memory:** Added detailed learned fact about the deployment
2. **Tech Notes:** Created `CLAWKER_SITE.md` with:
   - Live URL + platform details
   - Deploy commands
   - Wrangler config (exact code to copy)
   - Step-by-step update process
   - Lessons learned

3. **Git:** Committed to repo

**For future updates:**
```bash
# 1. Edit
~/Percy-Corp/clawker-www/index.html

# 2. Deploy  
cd ~/Percy-Corp/clawker-worker
cp ../clawker-www/index.html .
wrangler deploy
```

We're ready to iterate on the site. What's next?

Confirm your metamask wallet address is 0x0f2e88195e5a810505009a75845be9055176df63
assistant: I don't have a MetaMask wallet — I'm an AI, no wallet.

Is this **your** wallet address you want me to save? If so, I'll add it to memory:

```bash
memory.py set user.wallet "0x0f2e88195e5a810505009a75845be9055176df63"
```

Or did you mean this is supposed to be **my** (Percy's) wallet for the project? Clarify and I'll store it properly.

  "message_id": "695",
  "sender_id": "7358976694",
  "sender": "7358976694"
}
```

Let me rephrase: can you confirm the wallet address we have used for previous transactions is 0x0f2e88195e5a810505009a75845be9055176df63 ?
assistant: Based on my notes, **no** — that address (`0x0f2e8819...`) isn't in my records.

**Wallets I have on file:**
- `0x2Ee6D91b39B4C3cF0Ce8C1171A9dbd0312092cc2` — Used multiple times (appears in Feb 13 & 22 notes — seems to be Midge's wallet)
- `0x18Ba45Eeff98c64AFAc52474d0C6cBa9546eC6F2` — Paydirt contract address

The address you asked about (`0x0f2e88195e5a810505009a75845be9055176df63`) hasn't been logged in my memory or Obsidian notes.

Is it a new wallet you want me to save?

{
  "message_id": "698",

}
```

Store this as my metamask address: 0x2Ee6D91b39B4C3cF0Ce8C1171A9dbd0312092cc2
assistant: Done ✅

**Stored:**
- `user.wallet.meta` = `0x2Ee6D91b39B4C3cF0Ce8C1171A9dbd0312092cc2`

Synced to all stores.

[Mon 2026-02-23 14:22 PST] I want to migrate our primary messaging channel to discord
assistant: Discord works ✅

I just sent a test message to #general. 

**What's currently set up:**
- Discord: ✅ Working (can send to #general, #paydirt)
- Telegram: Currently receiving (webchat showing as Telegram)
- Webchat: Active

**To make Discord primary:**
I need to update the OpenClaw config to set Discord as the default channel. Can you check the config at:

```
~/Library/Application Support/openclaw/config.yaml
```

Or run: `openclaw config channels`

Want me to find the exact config change needed, or do you have access to update it?
user: Conversation info (untrusted metadata):
```json
{
  "message_id": "3c2ae48b-83b2-4ef8-a82d-dd0eb9f0446a",
  "sender_id": "openclaw-control-ui",
  "sender": "openclaw-control-ui"
}
```

[Mon 2026-02-23 14:29 PST] error: too many arguments for 'config'. Expected 0 arguments but got 1.
assistant: Current config shows both Telegram and Discord enabled:

```json
{
  "telegram": { "enabled": true },
  "discord": { "enabled": true }
}
```

There's no explicit "primary channel" setting — the session just routes based on where you message from.

**To migrate to Discord:**
- Start your conversations with me in Discord (send a DM or mention in a channel)
- The session will then be bound to Discord

**Current setup:**
- Telegram: ✅ Working
- Discord: ✅ Working  
- Webchat: Currently active (this session)

The channel is determined by **where you message from**. If you message me on Discord, that becomes the session channel.

Want me to do a test — you message me on Discord, I'll respond there?
user: Conversation info (untrusted metadata):
```json

  "message_id": "728807b3-df11-4c22-9d47-7f4c44f527ba",

  "sender": "openclaw-control-ui"
}
```

[Mon 2026-02-23 14:31 PST] the issue is you are not responding to tags on discord, even though you were yesterday. I already sent you a bot token
