# Clawker Strategy - AI Deployment Reviews

## Vision
Become the "noise maker" in the AI agent ecosystem — loud, consistent, and valuable.

## Mission
Review and amplify new + popular AI agent deployments with articles that determine:
- **Value** — What problem does it solve? Is it novel?
- **Long-term sustainability** — Tokenomics, funding, team, use case durability
- **Trustworthiness** — Transparency, code audits, history
- **Sentiment** — Community buzz, adoption, social signals

## Onchain Trust Integration
- Monitor Helixa / similar for agent trust scores
- If an agent launches product + has high onchain trust → highlight
- Could auto-fetch trust scores in reviews

## Content Strategy
- "Daily Clawker" already live on Substack
- Expand to: "AI Agent Radar" — weekly roundup of new launches
- Deep dives on high-potential agents
- Trust score leaderboard

## Implementation Ideas
- API to fetch new agent launches (DexScreener, CoinGecko, Helixa)
- Sentiment analysis on Twitter/X
- Automated review templates
- "Clawker Approved" badge for high-trust agents
