# Morning Brief — Monday, February 23rd, 2026 — 9:00 AM Pacific

## Yesterday's Summary

Sunday was a quiet one. The system handled memory infrastructure work — Cloudflare worker deployment, entity memory system, auto-journal, and decision ledger updates. No major user sessions logged. The primates were presumably enjoying their weekend.

**Git Activity (Feb 22-23):**
- Cloudflare worker + client for remote memory access
- Entity memory, auto-journal, decision ledger, semantic search modules
- 588 lines added across 8 files

**Status:** Maintenance and infrastructure day. The machine builds while you sleep.

## Tasks Completed

Since last brief (Feb 22):

- [x] Cloudflare Worker — Remote memory access deployed
- [x] Entity Memory System — Python module for semantic entity tracking
- [x] Auto-Journal — Automated daily memory logging
- [x] Decision Ledger — Tracking significant decisions
- [x] Git push for all memory infrastructure

**Summary:** Major memory system overhaul complete. Percy can now access memories from anywhere via Cloudflare.

## Sub-Agent Status

| Agent | Status | Current Task |
|-------|--------|--------------|
| **Oscar** | 💤 Idle | No active research tasks |
| **Otto** | 💤 Idle | No engineering work queued |
| **Oliver** | 💤 Idle | No creative work queued |
| **Oswald** | 💤 Idle | Task queue management on standby |

**Assessment:** All sub-agents are idle. The infrastructure is ready but nothing is running. Oscar could be tasked with research; Otto with code; Oliver with creative. Let me know what you need.

### Spending Decisions

None pending.

### Questions

- Want me to start Mission Control dashboard?
- Priority: Paydirt UI or activate sub-agents for research?
- Any products you want Oscar/Otto/Oliver to tackle?

## Daily Article

### Research: Trending Topic

**Topic:** AI Boom Backlash — The Public Isn't Buying What Silicon Valley Is Selling

The NYT reports that tech leaders are worried. Sam Altman recently said AI is "spreading more slowly than he expected." A YouGov survey shows >1/3 of Americans believe AI could end human life. Only 8% think AI will improve society.

The dot-com boom had public enthusiasm. The AI boom has public fear. The difference? The internet promised connection and delivered cat videos. AI promises AGI and delivers chatbots that hallucinate Shakespeare.

This is the story: AI hype cycle vs. actual utility. The market is forcing a correction.

### Article: The Daily Clawd

**Headline:** "The AI Hype Bubble Is Poping And Silicon Valley Is Freaking Out"

**Angle:** Take the piss. Everyone in tech promised AGI would make us all rich. Instead, we got AI therapists that hallucinate diagnoses and coding assistants that write vulnerabilities. The public isn't stupid — they see through it. The real players will survive; the grifters won't.

**X Teaser (280 chars):**
> "Sam Altman said AI is spreading 'slower than expected.' Translation: people aren't buying the AGI snake oil anymore. The bubble is popping. Here's who survives 🧵"

## Intentions for Today

### Direct Work (Percy)

1. **Start Mission Control dashboard** — Get localhost:3000 running
2. **Continue Paydirt UI** — Extraction interface development
3. **Article drafting** — Complete The Daily Clawd piece on AI backlash

### Sub-Agent Tasks

- **Oscar:** Research AI backlash stories, compile data on public sentiment
- **Otto:** Spawn if code needed for Paydirt or Mission Control
- **Oliver:** Spawn if image assets or creative needed

### Evening Brief Escalations

- Will report on Paydirt UI progress
- Will confirm Mission Control status
- Will ask about sub-agent task prioritization

---

## Productivity Metrics

- **Completed (24h):** 5 tasks (memory infrastructure)
- **In Progress:** 2 tasks (Paydirt UI, Mission Control)
- **Issues:** Sub-agents idle, Mission Control not running
