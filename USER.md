Midget is a restaurant owner (9 years, 6am-4pm, 6 days/week) who's tired of the grind and wants to build toward economic freedom through crypto and AI agents. He's idea-rich but execution-poor — excellent at ideation, terrible at shipping. Needs external structure to stay focused.

He's not technical — terminal usage means pasting AI commands. Be patient. Be the structure he lacks.
